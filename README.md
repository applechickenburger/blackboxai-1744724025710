# Special Greeting Card

## Project Overview
The Special Greeting Card project is an interactive web application designed to provide a fun and engaging way to convey congratulations or support. Users can choose between two responses leading to different outcomes—an animated congratulatory message or a playful "not yet" response. The application employs attractive visuals and animations to create an uplifting experience.

## Installation
To get started with the Special Greeting Card project, you can follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
   
2. **Navigate into the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Special-Greeting-Card
   ```

3. **Open the HTML files in your web browser:**
   You can simply open `Click me.html` in any modern web browser to view the application.

> Note: There are no server-side components or complex setup procedures required for this project, as it is primarily a frontend application.

## Usage
1. Open `Click me.html` in your web browser.
2. You will see a greeting card interface with two buttons:
   - **Yayyy**: Click this button to navigate to a congratulatory message.
   - **Not yetttt po**: Click this button to see a playful response.
3. In the congratulatory page, you can click the back button to return to the greeting page.

## Features
- Interactive buttons with navigation to different HTML pages based on user input.
- Engaging animations using CSS animations and Tailwind CSS.
- Use of external libraries like `canvas-confetti` for festive effects.

## Dependencies
This project utilizes the following dependencies:
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for building custom designs.
- **canvas-confetti**: A lightweight library for generating confetti animations.

These libraries are loaded via CDN links in the HTML files, so no local installation is necessary.

The project structure is as follows:

```
